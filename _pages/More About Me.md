Personal Interest and Leisure Time Activity
======
* Basketball is my favorite sport. I enjoy playing basketball with friends every week. I'm a big fan of Golden State Warriors since 2013.
* I like playing piano and reading novels and sci-fi in my leisure time. "Three body problem" is my favorite sci-fi book.
* I also love hiking in state and national parks.
